## Motivation üåå üå†

Recently I worked on a MeteorJS project. The live version of the app is hosted on [Galaxy](https://www.meteor.com/hosting) and there was no staging environment for this one. So we needed to deploy another instance of this app in a staging environment. The codebase was hosted on GitLab and we have a shared cluster of MongoDB in mLab. While we wanted to run the staging environment efficiently, we also wanted to make sure the deployment is as cost-effective as we can.

## Finding üÜì options

While searching for free options, I have found these best possible options:

* [Heroku](https://heroku.com/) is one of the most used [PaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) currently which supports deploying app automatically from the GitHub repository. However, deploying from other code repositories like GitLab, Bitbucket etc aren‚Äôt supported yet.\
At the time of this writing, they support 4 different deployment methods:\
These are: _Heroku repo (GIT), GitHub, Dropbox, and Container Registry_

* We would also need a runner for the CD to run the job that checks the successful build of the codebase. GitLab provides shared runners for one repository for free!

## How I won the scenario? üèÜ

Ever wished for a deploy button? Pressing that would be fun!

But in our system, we don‚Äôt even need that button to press. Here‚Äôs how:

### 1. Set up Heroku API Key

First, we will need an app on Heroku. If you don‚Äôt have an app yet, create one. The app name will be needed later.

Then, we will need to set up the API key so that it can connect to the runner.

* Go to [dashboard.heroku.com/account](https://dashboard.heroku.com/account) to get the Heroku API Key.
* Place the Heroku API Key under **Settings ‚ûî CI / CD ‚ûî Variables**

{{< figure
    src="/img/tech/gitlab.png"
    caption="GitLab CI/CD Settings"
    class=big-picture
    align=center
>}}

We saved the key in a variable named `HEROKU_API_KEY`, we will use it later.

### 2. Write the GitLab deployment script

Now it‚Äôs time to write the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
My deployment script goes like this:

```yml
staging:
    type: deploy

    script:
    - apt-get update -qy
    - apt-get install -y ruby-dev
    - gem install dpl
    - dpl --provider=heroku --app=my_app --api-key=$HEROKU_API_KEY

    only:
    - master
```

As we can see, in the script section of the above snippet, we are installing ruby and a ruby gem called [dpl](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/examples/deployment/). It‚Äôs a deploy tool made by [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/) and can be used in GitLab as well. Then we are passing:

* provider name as heroku `--provider=heroku`
* the app name of our heroku app `--app=my_app`
* the api-key `--api-key=$HEROKU_API_KEY` which we have saved earlier

Finally we are defining which branch changes should trigger the deployment.

### 3. Setup GitLab Runner

To run the pipeline we will need to install a runner (machine) which will run scripts and other programs to make sure our app is building successfully.

This doc explains how we can install the runner either on our local machine or in Docker: [docs.gitlab.com/runner/install](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/install/)

### 4. Install Buildpack on Heroku (optional) for Meteor app

I‚Äôd recommend using the [Meteor Buildpack Horse](https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse) for Meteor app with Heroku which provides easy configuration to start the app. All we need to do is to define the `ROOT_URL` and `MONGO_URL`.

{{< figure
    src="/img/tech/heroku-config.png"
    caption="Heroku buildpack settings"
    class=big-picture
    align=center
>}}

And need to place the URL of this buildpack to Heroku, of course!
Other available environment vars can be found here: [github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse#environment](https://github.com/AdmitHub/meteor-buildpack-horse#environment)

I hope this short guide is helpful for beginners. Experts, please let me know suggestions and/or room for improvements if there‚Äôs any. Cheers!
