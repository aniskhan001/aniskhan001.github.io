      <description>Motivation üåå üå† Recently I worked on a MeteorJS project. The live version of the app is hosted on Galaxy and there was no staging environment for this one. So we needed to deploy another instance of this app in a staging environment. The codebase was hosted on GitLab and we have a shared cluster of MongoDB in mLab. While we wanted to run the staging environment efficiently, we also wanted to make sure the deployment is as cost-effective as we can.</description>

      <description>December 2017, at work, I had to deploy a micro-service very very quickly to support the core service of ours. The framework I used for this one was Sanic, (a micro-framework written in Python 3.5 with Async support). So, I get the python image first along with dependencies in a requirements.txt file. This is how it went:
FROMpython:3.6ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1ENV TZ=Asia/DhakaRUN ln -snf /usr/share/zoneinfo/$TZ /etc/localtime &amp;amp;&amp;amp; echo $TZ &amp;gt; /etc/timezoneRUN mkdir /appADD requirements.</description>
